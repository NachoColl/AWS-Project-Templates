# Static Website DevOps Pipeline - Version 1

This template creates a static website pipeline in AWS.

Some notes [here](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/devops-setup-automation-nacho-coll/).


## Deploy

You must launch this stack in **us-east-1**, as the related website SSL Certificate can only be used with CloudFront in us-east-1!

Also note that project developer IAM user is created but you need to manually grant access by setting a CodeCommit username/password or SSH.
